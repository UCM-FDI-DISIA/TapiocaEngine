# Shadow Mapping in %Ogre {#ShadowMappingOgre}

# Introduction to the Shadow Mapping Algorithm {#ShadowMappingIntro}

@tableofcontents

Shadow mapping, an algorithm introduced by Lance Williams  @cite WIL78 and
now prevalent in real-time and off-line rendering, is based on a simple
idea: First, a snapshot of the scene is taken from the viewpoint of the
light. Then, when creating an image from the perspective of the camera,
the light’s snapshot is used to determine visibility. Parts of the scene
seen by both the light and the camera must be lit (by the light in
question). Parts of the scene visible only to the camera must be
shadowed. We do not care about parts of the scene seen only by the
light.

Please note that this tutorial is more explicit and in depth than required
to merely render shadows in OGRE as to teach you the theory behind the
rendering shadows as well.

In practice, the snapshot from the viewpoint of the light is stored as a
floating point depth buffer. It is important to use a format that
supports enough precision to avoid shadow acne (z-fighting) on lit
surfaces. In Ogre, we can specify the depth format to use; in the
example code, we will choose the 32-bit format.

Once shadow determination has occurred (whether a fragment is in shadow
or not), Ogre provides two different ways to render the shadows into the
final image. The modulative technique will uniformly darken regions of
the image determined to be in shadow. This is a cheaper and less
accurate lighting model. For instance, specular highlights in shadow
will appear as darkened specular highlights. The other technique is
additive light masking. This technique builds up contributions from each
light in non-shadowed areas and adds them together to create the final
image. The code in section @ref Implementation will use additive light
masking, but could just as easily be adapted for modulative shadows.

## Formalism {#sm_formalism}

Mathematically, the process can be represented as follows: Let \f$P_l\f$ and
\f$P_c\f$ be the projection matrices for the light and camera respectively.
Let \f$M_l\f$ and \f$M_c\f$ be the modelview matrices for the light and camera
coordinate systems. Let \f$\vec{x} = [x_1,x_2,x_3,1]^t\f$ be a point in
object space, \f$\vec{y} = [y_1,y_2,y_3,1]^t\f$ the screen space
coordinates, and \f$\vec{u} = [u_1,u_2,u_3,1]^t\f$ the shadow map
coordinates.

\f[
	\begin{aligned}
	\left[ \begin{array}{c}
		u_1  w_l \\
		u_2  w_l \\
		u_3  w_l \\
		w_l     \end{array} \right] =  P_l M_l \left[ \begin{array}{c}
		x_1 \\
		x_2 \\
		x_3 \\
		1     \end{array} \right]\end{aligned}
\f]

\f[\begin{aligned}
	\left[ \begin{array}{c}
		y_1  w_c \\
		y_2  w_c \\
		y_3  w_c \\
		w_c     \end{array} \right] =  P_c M_c \left[ \begin{array}{c}
		x_1 \\
		x_2 \\
		x_3 \\
		1     \end{array} \right]\end{aligned}\f]

These equations can be written more concisely as:
\f$\vec{u}w_l = P_l M_l \vec{x}\f$ and \f$\vec{y} w_c = P_c M_c \vec{x}\f$.
Division of \f$\vec{u}w_l\f$ and \f$\vec{y}w_c\f$ by their respective
homogeneous coordinates yields the Euclidean representations \f$\vec{u}\f$
and \f$\vec{y}\f$.

Note that while \f$P_c\f$ and \f$M_c\f$ are completely determined by the camera
image we want to produce, we have some ambiguity in the \f$P_l\f$ and \f$M_l\f$
chosen for shadow mapping. The degrees of freedom here are later
exploited to combat the aliasing issue.

## Depth Biasing {#DepthBias}

![](images/depthbias.svg) Shadow map sample must use one float to represent a range of possible depth values.
A depth sample is chosen in the middle.
Any camera image point in between the two camera rays will see the geometry, 
and depending on distance from light will report differently on shadowed versus lit.
However, every such point should be lit.

Due to the finite precision of floating point representations and
inherent inability of one number to represent a range of values, it is
often necessary to add a little bias to the depth values stored in a
shadow map. One does not simply store the \f$u_3\f$ value. Figure
\[fig:bias\] illustrates the issue. Here we have used blue dots on the
light’s image plane to represent boundaries between shadow “texels.” The
interval in between the dots then represents a shadow map sample for
which a single depth value (float) is stored. For the sample whose
boundary rays are shown, the red dot’s depth is saved. However, note
that from the camera’s perspective, any (camera) image point in between
the two drawn camera rays will hit the scene geometry within the shadow
map sample’s interval. Hence, the same shadow map sample depth will be
used to determine visibility for all such camera pixels. Camera pixels
whose rays fall to the right of the red dot will be marked as shadowed,
while pixels whose rays fall to the left of the red dot will be marked
as lit. This is not the right behavior because clearly all the pixels
should be marked as lit. As we can see, a depth bias is needed. By
pushing the shadow map sample’s depth farther (to the 2nd red dot), we
can achieve correct shadow determination.

One could approach the depth bias issue in a completely <span>*ad
hoc*</span> manner, but it is possible to do better. One would ideally
compute a bias that depends on how depth (\f$u_3\f$) changes between shadow
map samples. The change in depth as one moves a unit step (to the next
shadow map sample) represents the ambiguity of the depth value. Such a
value may seem intractable to compute, but calculus and linear algebra
save the day. From calculus, we learn that the derivative provides the
best linear approximation to any function (\f$u_3 = u_3(u_1, u_2)\f$ in
particular). In multiple dimensions, this role is played by the Jacobian
(matrix of partial derivatives). In other words, we want to compute
\f$\frac{du_3}{du_1}\f$ and \f$\frac{du_3}{du_2}\f$, where we have treated \f$u_3\f$
as a function of \f$u_1\f$ and \f$u_2\f$. Once these values are computed, it
makes sense to then add some weighted combination of these to the stored
depth value (e.g., some scale of the Jacobian’s Frobenius norm).

But even if the light is staring at a plane straight on (view direciton
lines up with plane’s normal), making \f$\frac{du_3}{du_1}\f$ and
\f$\frac{du_3}{du_2}\f$ both zero, we would still need a slight offset
because rounding due to the float’s finite representation may still
cause shadow acne. In this case, we’d like to offset the depth by a
small value that pushes it beyond rounding ambiguity. While one could
use an arbitrary constant offset, this is unsatisfactory since the
constant in light image space corresponds to varying amounts of offset
in light space (pre-projection Euclidean space with light’s position at
origin). Let us instead choose a constant offset in the z direction of
<span>*light space*</span> and compute what the offset for a particular
sample should be in <span>*light image space*</span>. In Ogre’s example
code, the small constant offset in light space is chosen to be 1 unit.
If 1 is not a small amount in your engine’s chosen scale, you can easily
change this choice. At any rate, the relevant quantity is
\f$\frac{\partial u_3}{\partial X_3}\f$ where \f$\vec{X} = M_l \vec{x}\f$.

The choices here closely mirror what OpenGL implements through
glPolygonOffset. The second adjustment is slightly different since
OpenGL chooses a vendor specific fudge factor.

Equations for computing the stated quantities are provided below. One
need not wade through these to use the depth biasing code. Understanding
what the relevant parameters explained above are (in case adjustment is
needed) is sufficient.

\f[\begin{aligned}
\label{eqn:dxqdu}
  \frac{\partial (\vec{x} q_l)}{\partial u_i} = \mbox{i-th column of } M_l^{-1} P_l^{-1} V_l^{-1} \end{aligned}\f]

where \f$V_l\f$ is the viewport matrix for the light and \f$i=1,2,3\f$. \f$q_l\f$
turns out to be \f$1/w_l\f$.

\f[\begin{aligned}
\label{eqn:dxdu}
  \frac{\partial \vec{x}}{\partial u_i} = \frac{1}{q_l} \left( \frac{\partial (\vec{x} q_l)}{\partial u_i} - \vec{x}\frac{\partial q_l}{\partial u_i} \right) \\
\label{eqn:du3du}
  \frac{du_3}{du_j} = \left( \vec{n} \cdot \frac{\partial \vec{x}}{\partial u_3} \right)^{-1} \left( \vec{n} \cdot \frac{\partial \vec{x}}{\partial u_j} \right)\end{aligned}\f]

where \f$\vec{n}\f$ is the normal at point \f$\vec{x}\f$ and \f$j=1,2\f$. Note that
(\[eqn:du3du\]) is exactly the set of values needed for the first part.

\f[\begin{aligned}
\label{eqn:duwdX3}
  \frac{\partial (\vec{u} w_l)}{\partial X_3} = \mbox{3rd column of } P_l \\
\label{eqn:dudX3}
  \frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial X_3} = \frac{1}{w_l} \left( \frac{\partial (\vec{u} w_l)}{\partial X_3} - \vec{u}\frac{\partial w_l}{\partial X_3} \right)\end{aligned}\f]

Note that (\[eqn:dudX3\]) is the quantity needed for the second bias
term. This is also the term to scale for different choices of small
offset in light space. If 0.01 units is the small offset, scale this
value by 0.01.

## Percentage Closest Filtering {#sm_pcm}

As widely known, shadow mapping can exhibit significant aliasing. When
this happens during texture mapping we apply filtering. We’d like to
apply a similar principle with shadow maps, but filtering depth values
is categorically the wrong thing to do. As described in  @cite RSC87, one
should instead filter depth test results. This is termed percentage
closest filtering. Ideally this would be a filtering technique much like
anisotropic texture filtering, but for simplicity and efficiency, Ogre’s
example code implements the bilinear analogue.

# Variants {#sm_variants}


There are many shadow mapping variants. Enumerating (much less
describing) all of them would take us too far afield in this article. We
instead defer to the provided references and google for such coverage.
The many variants can, however, be broken up into three broad
categories:
1. Those that store additional information beyond a single
float,
2. Those that divide up shadow frusta into multiple frusta to be
handled separately, and
3. Those that propose less naive \f$P_l\f$ and
\f$M_l\f$ to use and thereby affect the sampling distribution. 

Algorithms in each category usually work quite independently and so many hybrid
approaches are easily conceivable.

## Storing Additional Info {#sm_additional_info}

One example of this is Deep Shadow Maps  @cite LV00. In this work, instead of
storing a single depth value and treating visibility as a binary value,
a transfer function is stored and visibility is continuous. This
algorithm is important in offline movie rendering, but also relevant to
the Variance Shadow Mapping algorithm elucidated by the game developer
community  @cite DL06.

While variance shadow maps are motivated by statistical considerations,
it is perhaps more properly understood in the Deep Shadow Maps
framework. Analyzing it in terms of distributions is flawed for two
reasons:
1. The inequality considered is valid only for unimodal
distributions whereas depth values are often discontinuous in regions
that matter; 
2. The inequality is treated as equality. The equations
are justified with a very specific example in which two planes are
viewed straight on. In practice there are very noticeable halo effects
around objects, which makes more heuristic tweaks necessary.

Recasting this into the framework of deep shadow maps, we see that the
proposed equality is simply a particular functional approximation to the
transfer function. Variance shadow maps proposes a two-parameter family
of approximation functions whose parameters are linearly interpolated in
the usual way. This viewpoint allows for analysis and also suggests the
possibility of getting improvements via other approximating functional
forms.

## Breaking up Shadow Frusta {#sm_breaking_frusta}

Adaptive Shadow Maps @cite FFB01 are an example of this. It is still largely
considered too expensive for real-time rendering, but continued research
and growing GPU power may make some variant worthwhile.

## Playing with Projection Matrices {#sect_planeopt}

There are various heuristic approaches for choosing \f$P_l\f$ and \f$M_l\f$, but
here we will focus on one method, the Plane Optimal algorithm  @cite Chong04,
that provides a particular guarantee. For this algorithm, we specify a
plane of interest (e.g., ground plane, wall, table top) for which we
want perfect shadowing no matter the configuration of light and camera
in the scene (even dueling frusta). The algorithm will then compute
\f$P_l\f$ and \f$M_l\f$ so that the mapping between camera image and light image
is the identity when restricted to the plane. If the shadow map matches
the resolution of the screen, then each pixel gets exactly one shadow
sample. Shadows off the plane of interest have no guarantees. One
limitation of the method is shown in Figure \[fig:planeopt\]. Only
region I will be shadowed and self-shadowed properly, with points on the
plane being shadowed perfectly (alias-free). This makes the method
perhaps most useful for games where the view is top-down or isometric
(like RTS games). It is also useful for cases like dueling frusta (where
just about all other methods fail).

![](images/optfrust.svg) Region I is defined as the set of all points along rays between the light and a point on the plane of interest in the camera’s view. Everything in region I is shadowed and self-shadowed properly. Objects in region II are not self-shadowed properly.

# Theory and Analysis {#sm_theory}

A full discussion of shadow map analysis is beyond the scope of this
article. For those interested, the references  @cite Chong06 and  @cite Chong04
are good (in my extremely biased opinion). Note that as research papers,
they are quite concise. Unfortunately there don’t seem to more
step-by-step expositions available at this moment.

There has been a lot of academic and industry research on improving
shadow maps. However, analyses presented on shadow maps often do not say
what people claim they say. These faulty conclusions usually come from
considering very special cases and assuming the general case is very
similar. For clarification, we explore some of these misconceptions
here.

## (Non) Optimality of Logarithmic Shadow Maps {#sm_nonopt}

We start with one *heuristic* that has gained quite a bit
of traction: the idea of using some logarithmic mapping between light
space and light image space instead of a projective transform. A number
of algorithms based on this idea have been proposed, and even some
hardware changes. Much of this work seems to be motivated by the
incorrect assumption that logarithmic mappings are optimal.

The very special motivating case is this: The camera looks down the z
axis. Directional light illuminates the scene perpendicular to the z
axis. An angled piece of a plane is viewed by the camera. As the angled
piece of plane is pulled along the camera ray direction, using a
logarithmic shadow map gives us constant shadow quality on this
geometric piece. But unless we’re rendering translucent dust particles
along a camera ray, this analysis is irrelevant. If the dust particles
are not translucent, we only care about shadow determination on the
first one, not a whole line of them. If we are rendering continuous
surfaces (resp. curves), we care about the quality as one moves in the
tangent plane (resp. tangent) direction because this is the best linear
approximation to the surface (resp. curve), not the camera ray
direction.

In fact, in the case of a chosen plane of interest for example, we know
we can get completely alias free shadow mapping using a projective
transform (section @ref sect_planeopt). Logarithmic shadow maps may be an
interesting heuristic to try out, but certainly not worth changing
hardware over in my opinion. If you’re going to change hardware, might
as well aim for true optimality.

## Sampling Aliasing versus Depth Precision Aliasing {#sm_aliasing}

Sometimes people tend to conflate these two sources of aliasing. They
note that after applying some sort of custom projective transform, the
depth values are warped as well. This problem can be completely overcome
via the depth replacement method prescribed in Trapezoidal Shadow Maps
 @cite MT04. So this is a completely orthogonal issue. Depth precision can be
just as good as “normal” shadow maps, no matter the perspective warp
used to affect sampling.

## Projective versus Perspective Aliasing {#sm_proj_aliasing}

The terms perspective and projective aliasing appeared in the
Perspective Shadow Maps  @cite SD02 paper and has since been used extensively
by those who work on improving shadow heuristics. Often it is claimed
that methods ameliorate perspective aliasing while projective aliasing
is either unavoidable or must be addressed via completely separate
means. However, the distinction between the two is somewhat artificial.
Both result from not allocating enough shadow map samples to regions
that matter to the viewer. As the Plane Optimal algorithm demonstrates,
it is possible to completely remove projective aliasing (as well as
perspective aliasing) in certain scenes. In general, there should be one
combined measure of aliasing and algorithms must minimize this quantity.
See  @cite Chong06 for a unified notion of aliasing.

# Implementation {#Implementation}

Ogre provides a powerful framework that allows us to do a lot of shadow
map customization. In Ogre, we turn on custom shadow mapping through the
scene manager (here, sceneMgr). It is recommended that this happen early
as it may affect how certain resources are loaded.

```cpp
// Use Ogre's custom shadow mapping ability
MaterialManager *materialMgr = Ogre::MaterialManager::getSingletonPtr();
sceneMgr->setShadowTexturePixelFormat(PF_DEPTH16);
sceneMgr->setShadowTechnique( SHADOWTYPE_TEXTURE_ADDITIVE );
sceneMgr->setShadowTextureCasterMaterial(materialMgr->getByName("Ogre/DepthShadowmap/Caster/Float"));
sceneMgr->setShadowTextureReceiverMaterial(materialMgr->getByName("Ogre/DepthShadowmap/Receiver/Float"));
sceneMgr->setShadowTextureSelfShadow(true); 
sceneMgr->setShadowTextureSize(1024);
```

The setShadowTechnique call is all that is required for Ogre’s default
shadow mapping. In the code above, we have told Ogre to use a 16-bit depth texture.
This tends to be a very portable method (over graphics cards and APIs). The sample
uses 1024x1024 shadow maps. Self-shadowing is
turned on, but be warned that this will only work properly if
appropriate depth biasing is also used. The example code will manually
account for depth biasing via the method described above in section
@ref DepthBias. The shadow caster and shadow receiver materials are
defined in a material script. They tell Ogre which shaders to use when
rendering shadow casters into the shadow map and rendering shadow
receivers during shadow determination.

The `DepthShadowmap.material` script is given below:

@snippet Samples/Media/materials/scripts/DepthShadowmap.material shadow_material

The material uses unified programs for HLSL, GLSL and GLSLES. 
We’ll present the GLSL code below. Note that while most of the
shader files are direct translations of each other, DirectX HLSL shaders
must handle percentage closest filtering slightly differently from
OpenGL. OpenGL chooses the convention of having integers index sample
centers whereas DirectX chooses integers to index sample corners. Also
note the variable names in the shaders presented below are slightly
different from those presented earlier in this document. This is due in
part to the awkwardness of expressing subscripts in variable names and
also in part because \f$u_3\f$ is less evocative of depth than \f$z\f$, etc.
With minimal effort one can match the shader equations with those
presented earlier. The code is presented here mostly to demonstrate how
things fit together.

@include Samples/Media/materials/programs/GLSL/pssmCasterVp.glsl

This is a pretty standard vertex shader.

@include Samples/Media/materials/programs/GLSL/pssmCasterFp.glsl

Just write out the depth values here. The bias and derivatives are handled by the @c depth_bias set in the pass.

@include Samples/Media/materials/programs/GLSL/DepthShadowmapReceiverVp.glsl

This is a pretty standard vertex shader as well.

@include Samples/Media/materials/programs/GLSL/DepthShadowmapReceiverFp.glsl

Additionally this file implements percentage closest filtering. To use unfiltered
shadow mapping, comment out the PCF block as noted and uncomment the
Non-PCF block. Note that after doing this, the uSTexWidth and
uSTexHeight variables are likely to be optimized away and so you should
uncomment these variables in the materials script as well.

## Debugging Shadows
Since shadows are a difficult subject, so it is a good idea to have the Shadow Map 
projected on a Mini-Screen where it is possible to see how the Depth Caster is performing.

Material definition: `shadow_debug.material`
```
material ShadowDebug
{
	technique
	{
		pass
		{
			lighting off

			texture_unit ShadowMap
			{
				tex_address_mode clamp
				filtering none
				content_type shadow
			}
		}
	}
}
```

With only this material definition the [RTSS (Realtime Shader System)](@ref rtss) 
takes care of generating the proper shader to project the Shadow Map on the Mini Screen.

Source code to create a Rectangle on the screen and project the Shadow Map texture:
```cpp
// Create rectangle for the Mini-Screen and attach to node
Ogre::Rectangle2D* miniScreen = mSceneMgr->createScreenSpaceRect(true);
miniScreen->setCorners(.5, 1.0, 1.0, .5);
miniScreen->setBoundingBox(Ogre::AxisAlignedBox::BOX_INFINITE);
miniScreen->setMaterial(Ogre::MaterialManager::getSingletonPtr()->getByName("ShadowDebug"));

Ogre::SceneNode* miniScreenNode = mSceneMgr->getRootSceneNode()->createChildSceneNode();
miniScreenNode->attachObject(miniScreen);
```

## Improving Shadow Quality

The default projection used when rendering shadow textures is a uniform frustum.
This is pretty straight forward but doesn't make the best use of the space in the shadow map 
since texels closer to the camera will be larger, resulting in 'jaggies'.
There are several ways to distribute the texels in the shadow texture differently.
Ogre is provided with several alternative shadow camera setups:
 - Ogre::FocusedShadowCameraSetup: Implements the uniform shadow mapping algorithm in focused mode.
 - Ogre::LiSPSMShadowCameraSetup: Implements the Light Space Perspective Shadow Mapping Algorithm.
 - Ogre::PSSMShadowCameraSetup: Parallel Split Shadow Map (PSSM) shadow camera setup.
 - Ogre::PlaneOptimalShadowCameraSetup: Implements the plane optimal shadow camera algorithm.

These Shadow Camera Setups can be enabled for the whole Scene with SceneManager::setShadowCameraSetup 
or per light with Light::setCustomShadowCameraSetup

The following shows how to activate Plane Optimal Shadow Mapping given
some pointer to a MovablePlane and a pointer to a light.
```cpp
Ogre::MovablePlane *movablePlane = new Ogre::MovablePlane( Ogre::Vector3::UNIT_Y, 0 );
Ogre::Entity *movablePlaneEntity = mSceneMgr->createEntity( "movablePlane", "Floor.mesh" );
Ogre::SceneNode *movablePlaneNode = mSceneMgr->getRootSceneNode()->createChildSceneNode("MovablePlaneNode");
movablePlaneNode->attachObject(movablePlaneEntity);
Ogre::ShadowCameraSetupPtr shadowCameraSetup = Ogre::PlaneOptimalShadowCameraSetup::create(movablePlane);
light->setCustomShadowCameraSetup(Ogre::ShadowCameraSetupPtr(shadowCameraSetup));
```

Another example, using LiSPSM Camera Setup:
```cpp
Ogre::ShadowCameraSetupPtr shadowCameraSetup = Ogre::LiSPSMShadowCameraSetup::create();
mSceneMgr->setShadowCameraSetup(shadowCameraSetup);
```

For big scenes with directional lights one of the better performing Shadow Camera Setups is PSSM.
A PSSM shadow system uses multiple shadow maps per light and maps each texture into a region of space, 
progressing away from the camera. As such it is most appropriate for directional light setups.
A more in depth explanation can be found in the wiki: [Parallel Split Shadow Mapping](https://wiki.ogre3d.org/Parallel+Split+Shadow+Mapping)

```cpp
// General scene setup
mSceneMgr->setShadowTechnique(Ogre::SHADOWTYPE_TEXTURE_ADDITIVE_INTEGRATED);
mSceneMgr->setShadowTextureCasterMaterial(Ogre::MaterialManager::getSingletonPtr()->getByName("PSSMCaster"));
mSceneMgr->setShadowTextureSelfShadow(true);
mSceneMgr->setShadowFarDistance(3000);
// 3 textures per directional light (PSSM)
mSceneMgr->setShadowTextureCountPerLightType(Ogre::Light::LT_DIRECTIONAL, 3);
mSceneMgr->setShadowTextureCount(3);
mSceneMgr->setShadowTextureConfig(0, 2048, 2048, Ogre::PF_DEPTH16);
mSceneMgr->setShadowTextureConfig(1, 1024, 1024, Ogre::PF_DEPTH16);
mSceneMgr->setShadowTextureConfig(2, 512, 512, Ogre::PF_DEPTH16);

Ogre::PSSMShadowCameraSetup* pssmSetup = new Ogre::PSSMShadowCameraSetup(); //static_cast<Ogre::PSSMShadowCameraSetup*>(shadowCameraSetup->getPointer());
pssmSetup->setSplitPadding(1);
pssmSetup->calculateSplitPoints(3, 1, mSceneMgr->getShadowFarDistance());
pssmSetup->setOptimalAdjustFactor(0, 2);
pssmSetup->setOptimalAdjustFactor(1, 1);
pssmSetup->setOptimalAdjustFactor(2, 0.5);
mSceneMgr->setShadowCameraSetup(Ogre::ShadowCameraSetupPtr(pssmSetup));
```

The Shadow Caster Vertex and Fragment programs are the same as the regular shadow mapping techniques.

But some changes have to be made to the shaders of the Shadow Receiver as well as the program definition, because now we are sending three shadow map splits (in this example).

Material definition:
```
sampler DepthSampler
{
	filtering none
	tex_address_mode clamp
	tex_border_colour 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0
}

material PSSMShadowReceiver
{
	technique default
	{
		pass
		{
			vertex_program_ref PSSMShadowReceiverVP {}
			fragment_program_ref PSSMShadowReceiverFP {}

			texture_unit ShadowMap0
			{
				content_type shadow
				sampler_ref DepthSampler
			}

			texture_unit ShadowMap1
			{
				content_type shadow
				sampler_ref DepthSampler
			}

			texture_unit ShadowMap2
			{
				content_type shadow
				sampler_ref DepthSampler
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Program definition:
```
vertex_program PSSMShadowReceiverVP glsl
{
	source PSSMShadowReceiver.vert

	default_params
	{
		param_named_auto world world_matrix
		param_named_auto worldIT inverse_transpose_world_matrix
		param_named_auto worldViewProj worldviewproj_matrix
		param_named_auto lightPosition light_position 0
		param_named_auto lightColour light_diffuse_colour 0

		param_named_auto texViewProj0 texture_viewproj_matrix 0
		param_named_auto texViewProj1 texture_viewproj_matrix 1
		param_named_auto texViewProj2 texture_viewproj_matrix 2
	}
}

fragment_program PSSMShadowReceiverFP glsl
{
	source PSSMShadowReceiver.frag

	default_params
	{
		param_named shadowMap0 int 0
		param_named shadowMap1 int 1
		param_named shadowMap2 int 2

		param_named pssmSplitPoints float4 0 0 0 0
	}
}
```

The vertex shader now includes three texture projection matrixes
```glsl
#version 330 core

layout (location = 0) in vec4 vertex;
layout (location = 2) in vec3 normal;

uniform mat4 world;
uniform mat4 worldIT;
uniform mat4 worldViewProj;
uniform vec4 lightPosition;
uniform vec4 lightColour;

uniform mat4 texViewProj0;
uniform mat4 texViewProj1;
uniform mat4 texViewProj2;

out vec4 outColor;

out vec4 oUv0;
out vec4 oUv1;
out vec4 oUv2;

out float depth;

void main()
{
	gl_Position = worldViewProj * vertex;
	depth = gl_Position.z;

	vec4 worldPos = world * vertex;

	vec3 worldNorm = (worldIT * vec4(normal, 1.0)).xyz;

	// calculate lighting (simple vertex lighting)
	vec3 lightDir = normalize(lightPosition.xyz - (worldPos.xyz * lightPosition.w));

	outColor = lightColour * max(dot(lightDir, worldNorm), 0.0);

	// calculate shadow map coords
	oUv0 = texViewProj0 * worldPos;
	oUv1 = texViewProj1 * worldPos;
	oUv2 = texViewProj2 * worldPos;
}
```

And the fragment shader has to be accommodated to select the correct Shadow Map according to the camera distance
```glsl
#version 330 core

in vec4 oUv0;
in vec4 oUv1;
in vec4 oUv2;

in vec4 outColor;

in float depth;

uniform sampler2D shadowMap0;
uniform sampler2D shadowMap1;
uniform sampler2D shadowMap2;

uniform vec4 pssmSplitPoints;

void shadowFilter( sampler2D shadowMap, vec4 oUv, vec3 splitColour )
{
	// Perform perspective divide
	vec4 shadowUV = oUv;
	shadowUV = shadowUV / shadowUV.w;

	// Transform [-1, 1] to [0, 1] range
	shadowUV.z = shadowUV.z * 0.5 + 0.5;

	// Get closest depth value from light's perspective (using [0,1] range fragPosLight as coords)
	float centerdepth = texture2D(shadowMap, shadowUV.xy).x;

	// Check whether current frag pos is in shadow
	gl_FragColor = (finalCenterDepth > shadowUV.z) ? vec4(outColor.xyz * splitColour, 1.0) : vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
}

void main()
