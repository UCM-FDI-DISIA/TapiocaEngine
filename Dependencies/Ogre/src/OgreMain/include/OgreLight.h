    /** Representation of a dynamic light source in the scene.

        Lights are added to the scene like any other object. They contain various
        parameters like type, attenuation (how light intensity fades with
        distance), colour etc.

        The light colour is computed based on the
        [Direct3D Light Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d9/mathematics-of-lighting) as:

        \f[ L_d = C_d \cdot p \cdot ( N \cdot L_{dir}) \cdot A \cdot S \f]
        \f[ L_s = C_s \cdot p \cdot ( N \cdot H)^s \cdot A \cdot S \f]

        where
        \f[ A = \frac{1}{c + l \cdot d + q \cdot d^2} \f]
        and only computed when attenuation is enabled,

        \f[ S = \left[ \frac{\rho - cos(0.5 \cdot \phi)}{cos(0.5 \cdot \theta) - cos(0.5 \cdot \phi)} \right]^f \f]
        and only computed with spotlights

        - \f$C_d\f$ is the light diffuse colour
        - \f$C_s\f$ is the light specular colour
        - \f$p\f$ is the light power scale factor
        - \f$s\f$ is the surface shininess
        - \f$N\f$ is the current surface normal
        - \f$L_{dir}\f$ is vector from the vertex position to the light (constant for directional lights)
        - \f$H = normalised(L_{dir} + V)\f$, where V is the vector from the vertex position to the camera
        - \f$c, l, q\f$ are the constant, linear and quadratic attenuation factors
        - \f$d = |L_{dir}|\f$
        - \f$\theta, \phi, f\f$ are the spotlight inner angle, outer angle and falloff
        - \f$\rho = \langle L_{dir} , L_{dcs} \rangle \f$ where \f$L_{dcs}\f$ is the light direction in camera space

        The defaults when a light is created is pure white diffuse light, with no
        attenuation (does not decrease with distance) and a range of 1000 world units.

        Lights are created by using the SceneManager::createLight method. They subsequently must be
        added to a SceneNode to orient them in the scene and to allow moving them.

        Remember also that dynamic lights rely on modifying the colour of vertices based on the position of
        the light compared to an object's vertex normals. Dynamic lighting will only look good if the
        object being lit has a fair level of tessellation and the normals are properly set. This is particularly
        true for the spotlight which will only look right on highly tessellated models. In the future OGRE may be
        extended for certain scene types so an alternative to the standard dynamic lighting may be used, such
            as dynamic lightmaps.

            Calling this method simply associates a numeric index with a 4-dimensional
            value for this specific Light. This is most useful if the material
            which this Renderable uses a vertex or fragment program, and has an 
            ACT_LIGHT_CUSTOM parameter entry. This parameter entry can refer to the
            index you specify as part of this call, thereby mapping a custom
            parameter for this renderable to a program parameter.
        @param index
            The index with which to associate the value. Note that this
            does not have to start at 0, and can include gaps. It also has no direct
            correlation with a GPU program parameter index - the mapping between the
            two is performed by the ACT_LIGHT_CUSTOM entry, if that is used.
        @param value
            The value to associate.

            information only this Light knows.

            This method allows a Light to map in a custom GPU program parameter
            based on it's own data. This is represented by a GPU auto parameter
            of ACT_LIGHT_CUSTOM, and to allow there to be more than one of these per
            Light, the 'data' field on the auto parameter will identify
            which parameter is being updated and on which light. The implementation 
            of this method must identify the parameter being updated, and call a 'setConstant' 
            method on the passed in GpuProgramParameters object.
        @par
            You do not need to override this method if you're using the standard
            sets of data associated with the Renderable as provided by setCustomParameter
            and getCustomParameter. By default, the implementation will map from the
            value indexed by the 'constantEntry.data' parameter to a value previously
            set by setCustomParameter. But custom Renderables are free to override
            this if they want, in any case.
        @param paramIndex
            The index of the constant being updated
        @param constantEntry
            The auto constant entry from the program parameters
        @param params
            The parameters object which this method should call to 
            set the updated parameters.
