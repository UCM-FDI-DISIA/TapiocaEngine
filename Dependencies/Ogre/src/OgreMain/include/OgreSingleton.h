/** Template class for creating single-instance global classes.
 *
 * This implementation @cite bilas2000automatic slightly derives from the textbook pattern, by requiring
 * manual instantiation, instead of implicitly doing it in #getSingleton. This is useful for classes that
 * want to do some involved initialization, which should be done at a well defined time-point or need some
 * additional parameters in their constructor.
 *
 * It also allows you to manage the singleton lifetime through RAII.
 *
 * @note Be aware that #getSingleton will fail before the global instance is created. (check via
 * #getSingletonPtr)
