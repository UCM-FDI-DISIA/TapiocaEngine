        during a rendering state.  GLSL Vertex and fragment shader
        objects are compiled separately and then attached to a program
        object and then the program object is linked.  Since Ogre can
        only handle one vertex program and one fragment program being
        active in a pass, the GLSL Link Program Manager does the same.
        The GLSL Link program manager acts as a state machine and
        activates a program object based on the active vertex and
        fragment program.  Previously created program objects are
        stored along with a unique key in a hash_map for quick
        retrieval the next time the program object is required.
